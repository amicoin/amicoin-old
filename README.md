What is AMICoin?
----------------
AMICoin is a crypto-currency that has the aim of developing user-friendly features. The name comes from amigo (Spanish) and 
ami (French). It builds on the existing code-base of Bitcoin and newer Zxxxx digital currencies but is user-focused and
is oriented toward bringing crypto-currency to non-technical people (as a long term goal).
